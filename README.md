# cryptoArbitrageDemo
Demo version of CEX arbitrage.

It is a project that allows you to quickly get the differences between all CEX exchanges by using Websocket, take advantage of the price differences that occur here, and execute orders quickly (asynchronous is the best way for me).

I developed this project a long time ago and now I am working on a much more advanced version of it.

At the moment, I do not plan to publish the current project as Public.

To support me and access the whole project, or to run this project together, buy me a coffee and contact me by e-mail.
