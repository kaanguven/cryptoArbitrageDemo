# crypto Arbitrage Demo
Demo version of CEX arbitrage.

It is a project that allows you to quickly get the differences between all CEX exchanges by using Websocket, take advantage of the price differences that occur here, and execute orders quickly (asynchronous is the best way for me).

**FEATURES (for this one)**

Websockets

Auto bid asks for asset

Auto reconnects if you lose your websocket connection

Faster order execution for all exchanges.

Changeable difference pct between exchanges.
